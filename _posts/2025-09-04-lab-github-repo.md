Share the URL to your test repo (as created during class on Sep 5). For full credit, the repo history should demonstrate collaboration with changes submitted and approved (pushed and pulled) from at least one other person in the class.
For the collaboration exercise, each person should work through the "owner" tasks and "collaborator" tasks (see Canvas for the list of owners and collaborators).

| Owner | Collaborator |
| --- | --- |
| See Canvas for assignments | |

If you are the **owner**: invite your collaborator to work on your repository, and review and approve the changes they propose (note that we skipped over this review step in class, so it is optional but regardless of this step you will create a commit history that shows two contributors to your test repo). 

If you are the **collaborator**: look for an invitation from the repo owner, clone the repository locally, make changes and push the changes to the remote. To complete the lab, you should see at least two contributors when you view the log (aka commit history) - [it looks like this in the demo repo from class on Sep 5, 2025](https://github.com/morskyjezek/cookies-test/commits/main/) - and this should be visible to a public viewer. This collaboration workflow is also outlined on slides 13-16 in the GitHub slides at <{{ page.lab-slides }}>.

If you are new to Git and GitHub, or looking for a refresher, you may want to consult the Software Carpentry guide to setting up Git/GitHub, particularly
the episode on GitHub Collboration at <https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/08-collab.html>.
