## Building Out Your Omeka S Installation

This assignment builds on the Omeka S site that you previously created.
Your site and content should be created in the Omeka S installation from [last week's lab]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2025-10-02-lab-installing-omeka-s %}).

### Create a New Site in Omeka S for a Sample Collection

### Install the Import CSV Module

To see how the CSV might be structured, see the [CSV template for Omeka][csv-template]

### Load Sample Collection Content

Use the same collection items that you added to your CollectionBuilder site in Assignment 1a.
To do this, you can reuse the digital objects that you already gathered from the Library of Congress.
That is, the same items from Assignment 1a, as indicated in the file [`loc-resource-list.txt` located in the course data files repository](https://github.com/morskyjezek/si676-2025-data/blob/main/collection-site-materials/loc-resource-list.txt).

Your task is to restructure all of this into a format that allows you
to load it into Omeka S, then republish it on the new Omeka site you created.
Each item should publish on its own page and look something like [this sample page][sample-item-page].

## Deliverables

- Link to your new Omeka S site,
  now populated with the four items and their metadata
- Invite the course instructor as a user in your Omeka S site
