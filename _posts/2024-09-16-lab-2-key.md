![Sample file tree]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/sample-file-tree.png)

Working with the GitHub repo with sample files (which already contains a directory named `data`), provide the shell commands that you would use to accomplish the following. Assume that you start step one and
have already moved your command line prompt to the directory called `data`.

**Note:** The following examples use the `%` symbol to indicate the prompt.
The text before the prompt indicates the directory, or location of the command prompt.
If you have "moved" your prompt using a command like `cd`,
your responses may be slightly different.
Remember that the location context is all important in this interface!
The commands below assume you start in the `data` directory.

## Question 1

Create the directory structure shown above, in the “data” folder (hint: to make this task less onerous, check out the manual (`man`) page for the `mkdir` command that allows you to make parents of a directory that don’t exist yet).

_Most efficient solution:_

```shell
data % mkdir -p sample1/Louisiana sample1/Michigan sample2/Montana sample2/Idaho
```

_Alternatively, create each individually:_

```shell
data % mkdir sample1
data % mkdir sample2
data % mkdir sample1/Michigan
data % mkdir sample1/Louisiana
data % mkdir sample2/Montana
data % mkdir sample2/Idaho
```

_To see if the directories have been created, you can try:_

```shell
data % sample*
```

_The output should look like:_

```shell
sample1:
Louisiana	Michigan

sample2:
Idaho	Montana
```

## Question 2

Create an empty file `info.txt` in the Michigan directory and the Idaho directory.

_Assuming prompt is located in `data` directory:_

```shell
data % touch sample1/Michigan/info.txt sample2/Idaho/info.txt
```

_If you wanted to put text in the files, try something like:~

```shell
data % echo 'This is Michigan' > sample1/Michigan/info.txt
```

_To see if they have been created, try:_

```shell
data % ls sample*/*
```

_Output:_

```shell
sample1/Louisiana:

sample1/Michigan:
info.txt

sample2/Idaho:
info.txt

sample2/Montana:
```

## Question 3

Change your working directory to the Idaho directory.

```shell
data % cd sample2/Idaho
```

## Question 4

Copy the `info.txt` file to the Montana and Louisiana directories.

```shell
data/sample2/Idaho % cp info.txt ../Montana 
data/sample2/Idaho % cp info.txt ../../sample1/Louisiana
```

**Note:** The `cp` command can accept multiple arguments for the "source_file" (files that will be copied),
but it can only accept one destination.

## Question 5

Move the `info.txt` file in the Michigan directory to the `sample2` directory.

```shell
data/sample2/Idaho % mv ../../sample1/Michigan/info.txt ../
```

**Note:** this command will overwrite (erase) any file named info.txt that may already be at the destination.
To prevent this, you can use the `-i` flag.

## Question 6

Add three lines of your choice to the `info.txt` file in the `sample2` directory.

```shell
data/sample2/Idaho % echo 'This is more info from Michigan\nLine 2\nLine 3' >> ../info.txt
```

_To see if the text was appended:_

```shell
data/sample2/Idaho % cat ../info.txt
```

_Output if you ran the above `echo` command:_

```shell
This is Michigan
This is more info from Michigan
Line 2
Line 3
```

7. Return to the `data` directory.

```shell
data/sample2/Idaho % cd ../..
```

8. List the contents of your data directory in long form.

```shell
data % ls -l
```

_At this point, your output should look like this:_

```shell
total 8
drwxr-xr-x@  3 jajohnst  staff   96 Sep  8 23:29 animal-counts
drwxr-xr-x   3 jajohnst  staff   96 Sep  8 23:29 emails
drwxr-xr-x   9 jajohnst  staff  288 Sep  8 23:29 filenames-with-american-dates
drwxr-xr-x   2 jajohnst  staff   64 Sep  8 23:29 ftu_libs_metadata
drwxr-xr-x   7 jajohnst  staff  224 Sep  8 23:29 json

drwxr-xr-x  14 jajohnst  staff  448 Sep  8 23:29 xml
```

9. Display the contents of the `info.txt` file in the `sample2` directory

```shell
data % cat sample2/info.txt
```

**Note:** Your response will depend on what you've added to the file,
but you should see the text you've added print on the screen.

10. Delete the `info.txt` file in the `sample2` directory

```shell
data % rm sample2/info.txt
```

11. Delete the `Michigan` directory.

```shell
rmdir sample1/Michigan
```

**Note:** It is possible to use `rm` command, but that command is designed to remove files.
But you can delete directories with `rm`, too.
When deleting a directory with `rm`, you may need to add the `-r` flag, which makes the command 'recursive' and deletes all contents.
_Always use `rm` with care!_

## Additional Activity

We worked through three fundamental Git processes in class. Review these and bring questions for discussion next week.

* Create a Git repo (`git init`), which you should only run in a new directory, or a directory that you want to connect to a GitHub project, which creates (or "initializes") a new Git repository
* Update a git repo (`add` --> `commit`), which moves changes into the staging area and then adds them into your Git log and repo record
* Push/pull a git repo (`push` and `pull`), which moves local changes to your remote repository (in our case on GitHub though it needn't always be)

For next week, aim to make sure you can create local repositories, connect them to a remote, and push changes to that remote.
