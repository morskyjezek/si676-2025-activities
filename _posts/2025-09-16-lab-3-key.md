This page contains information for the [lab on DNS and Jekyll](), including answers to the Lab questions.

## GitHub Pages

Results for this activity will vary. To determine if your setup works, you should be able to see a page with some content serving at your GitHub pages output URL, which will be formatted like `USERNAME.github.io/REPO-NAME` where USERNAME is your GitHub user name and REPO-NAME is the name of the GitHub repository that is publishing the site.

## Jekyll

Again results will vary. But if you see a site something like this one, then you are on the right track.
You may see notes or suggestions from the instructor, which will appear as pull requests
in your GitHub repository.

## DNS Questions

### Question 1. Use the `dig` command to query `umich.edu`. What is the response and how would you explain it?

_Command:_
```shell
dig umich.edu
```

_Output:_
```

; <<>> DiG 9.10.6 <<>> umich.edu
;; global options: +cmd

_Explanation:_

The report is the response created by the DIG tool (Domain Information Groper)
that tells what the IP address for a given domain name is. In this case it also lists
additional DNS records for the associated nameservers and both IPv6 and IPv4 information.

### Question 2. Use the command for the above response, and pipe the output to a file named `umich-dns-record.txt`. Provide the text file.

```shell
dig umich.edu > umich-dns-record.txt
```

### Question 3. Use the `dig` command to query `umich.edu`. What is the command to return only the "answer" section of the response?  

```shell
dig +noall +answer umich.edu
```

## Bonus

Question: Note that you can ask for multiple domain names. For example: `dig +noall +answer si.umich.edu umich.edu wisc.edu education.wisc.edu`. The response is a good use case for a tool like `awk`. If you use a pipe to route the data from dig to awk, can you produce an output of just the domain and the IP address? 
  * The `awk` command is actually a sort of mini program language, particularly useful for querying and parsing text files with columns. If you want to learn more about it, you can look at the G-AWK manual at [https://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/gawk.html](https://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/gawk.html). It is very useful for parsing data in columns, which is a frequent pattern seen in the command line/text interface. Variables are named with dollar signs `$1` and the output patterns are enclosed in curly braces `{}`. This should be very similar to the exmaple presented in the slack channel, but you will need to add in a comma for the output.

```shell
dig +noall +answer si.umich.edu umich.edu wisc.edu education.wisc.edu
```

_Output:_
```
si.umich.edu.		1800	IN	A	18.221.166.136
umich.edu.		1800	IN	A	172.66.0.37
umich.edu.		1800	IN	A	162.159.140.37
wisc.edu.		14009	IN	A	144.92.9.70
education.wisc.edu.	14009	IN	A	99.83.210.234
education.wisc.edu.	14009	IN	A	75.2.33.159
```

With `awk`:

```shell
dig +noall +answer si.umich.edu umich.edu wisc.edu education.wisc.edu | awk '{print $1","$5}'
```

_Output:_

```shell
si.umich.edu.,18.221.166.136
umich.edu.,162.159.140.37
umich.edu.,172.66.0.37
wisc.edu.,144.92.9.70
education.wisc.edu.,99.83.210.234
education.wisc.edu.,75.2.33.159
```
