This page contains the information for *{{ page.title }}*.

This assignment is similar to last week.
First, you will need to set up a new repo, make sure it works with Jekyll,
and finally, install and configure the CollectionBuilder platform.
To do this, follow the instructions at [CollectionBuilder: CSV Walkthrough](https://collectionbuilder.github.io/cb-docs/docs/walkthroughs/csv-walkthrough/).

**Note:** you should not need ImageMagick or GhostScript at this point,
unless you want to experiment with adding objects and metadata of your own.

## Deliverables

* Link to a published, and working CollectionBuilder site, using the sample content from CB, publishing from a GitHub owned by your account
* Invite the course instructor to collaborate on the repo

## Resources

* [Jekyll Guide]({{ site.url }}{% link _posts/2024-09-27-jekyll-starter-guide.md %})
* [Assignment page on canvas]({{ page.canvas-link }})
