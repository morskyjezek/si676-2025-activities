This page contains the information for *{{ page.title }}*.

This assignment is similar to last week's: you are setting up a Jekyll site, but this time
you will usie an existing site structure and framework called CollectionBuilder.
First, you will need to set up a new repo (I would suggest something `collection-builder-test` or `demo-collection`).
Then, make sure it works with Jekyll.
Finally, install and configure the CollectionBuilder platform.
To do this, follow the instructions at CollectionBuilder: [CSV Walkthrough](https://collectionbuilder.github.io/cb-docs/docs/walkthroughs/csv-walkthrough/).

Once set up, make some basic modifications to your site. For example, give it an original name (use the `_config.yml`),
try selecting an alternative featured image to the default, etc.

**Note 1:** Keep your thinking hats on. Some of the steps you don't need to follow exactly (for example, you don't need to sign up for a GitHub account, you already have that). Your goal is a working site, the instructions give you the steps to get there, but you may need to address specific issues that come up with your site.

**Note 2:** you should not need ImageMagick or GhostScript at this point, unless you want to experiment with adding objects and metadata of your own.

## Deliverables

- Link to a published, and working CollectionBuilder site, using the sample content from CB, publishing from a GitHub owned by your account, and the corresponding GH repository.
- Invite the course instructor to collaborate on the repo
