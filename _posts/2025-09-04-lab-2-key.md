Solutions to this lab assignment will vary. In general, however, you
should be able to clearly see changes from two contributors in your
repositories commit history. You can access the commit history by using
the command `git log` when working in the shell.

Since the key is that these changes should be available on the remote,
you should also see these on GitHub, where they will look something like this:

![Viewing the basic collaboration workflow in GitHub commit history]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/github-collaboration-workflow.jpg "Viewing the basic collaboration workflow in GitHub commit history"){:style="border: 1px solid black;"}

**Hint:** You'll find your GitHub repo's commit history by appending `commits` to the end of your repo's URI! Or, click where it says commits and you see a "clock" icon with a backwards-pointing arrow.
