## Part One: Python Requests Lab

### 1. URL / URI Formulation

This assignment asked you to identify the LCCNs and LCCN permalinks for three items.
These are as follows:

| No. | Resource ID             | Resource page | LCCN       | permalink |
| 1.  | /resource/cph.3f05183/  | [https://www.loc.gov/resource/cph.3f05183/](https://www.loc.gov/resource/cph.3f05183/) | 98508155   | [https://lccn.loc.gov/98508155](https://lccn.loc.gov/98508155) |
| 2.  | /resource/fsa.8d24709/  | [https://www.loc.gov/resource/fsa.8d24709/](https://www.loc.gov/resource/fsa.8d24709/) | 2017843202 | [https://lccn.loc.gov/2017843202](https://lccn.loc.gov/2017843202) |
| 3.  | /resource/highsm.64003/ | [https://www.loc.gov/resource/highsm.64003/](https://www.loc.gov/resource/highsm.64003/) | 2020722343 | [https://lccn.loc.gov/2020722343](https://lccn.loc.gov/2020722343) |

### 2. Retrieve JSON data for items

This question asks you to use a programmatic approach to the above to gather and save the item metadata for each of the three items. At this stage it may not be required to create a function
to do this, but you should be starting to think of this as a repeatable process.
Therefore, while there are multiple ways this can be done, consider the following,
which uses the permalinks from a list to request the JSON and save it locally:

```python
import requests
import json

baseURL = 'https://www.loc.gov'
parameters = {'fo':'json'}
items = ['/resource/cph.3f05183/', '/resource/fsa.8d24709/', '/resource/highsm.64003/']

for item in items:
    r = requests.get(baseURL + item, params = parameters)
    fname = item.split('/')[-2] + '.json'
    json_data = r.json()
    with open(fname, 'w', encoding='utf-8') as f:
        f.write(json.dumps(json_data, indent=2))
```

### 3. Use a different parameter

Assume that the `https://www.loc.gov/search` address at the LOC can receive search requests by appending the parameter `q` to the URL.
This is a way to send a search query automatically via the URL (think of the variable `q` for "query").
Create a short block of Python code that queries the base URL.
Use the `input()` function so the code will ask the user for a unique query,
save that query as a string that will be inserted into the URI request as a parameter,
send the request using python requests,
and return the results.
The script should print out the results to the terminal or in the Jupyter notebook.
(In a production environment you would likely want to display such results in a browser or perhaps save them in a JSON file.)

```python
import requests

baseURL = 'https://www.loc.gov/'
endpoint = 'search'
query = input('Please type your search query: ')
parameters = {'q':query}

r = requests.get(baseURL + endpoint, params=parameters)

with open('search-response-' + query + '.html', 'w', encoding='utf-8') as f:
    f.write(r.text)
```

## Part Two: Adding Content to Your CB Collection Site
