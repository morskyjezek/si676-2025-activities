This page contains the information for *{{ page.title }}*.

This lab required you to set up a new CollectionBuilder site based on
the template they provided for CSV-based collection metadata.
Results will vary, but as long as your site appears at the corresponding `github.io`
URL, with the requested modifications to the site title and identity information,
then your work is done for this assignment.
