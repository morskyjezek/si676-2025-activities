This lab requests that you install Omeka S on your servers. Your process may vary somewhat, but when completed you should see some indication that Omeka S is running on your server at `http://UNIQNAME.si676.si.umich.edu/OMEKAS/` where UNIQNAME is replace with your uniqname and OMEKAS is replaced with the name of the directory where you installed Omeka S.

The screen you see should look something like this:

![Install Omeka S - first user]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/omekas-firstuser.jpg "Install Omeka S - first user"){:style="border: 1px solid black;"}

The steps of the process are outlined in the [Omeka S install guide]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2025-09-25-omeka-s-install-guide %}).
